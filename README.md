# User-Behavior-Analysis-A-A-B-Design-Testing
This project analyzes user behavior within a digital product and evaluates the impact of design changes using A/A/B testing. It examines user interaction patterns, validates the experimental setup, and assesses whether design modifications lead to statistically significant changes in behavior and conversion rates.

# User-Behavior-Analysis-A-A-B-Design-Testing
This project analyzes user behavior within a digital product and evaluates the impact of design changes using A/A/B testing. It examines user interaction patterns, validates the experimental setup, and assesses whether design modifications lead to statistically significant changes in behavior and conversion rates.
# Objective
Analyze user interaction patterns across the main stages of the product funnel
Measure engagement and conversion metrics
Validate data quality and experimental consistency using an A/A test
Evaluate the impact of design changes through A/B testing
Support UX and product decisions using statistical evidence

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains event-level data, including:
User identifiers and experimental group assignments
Event names and timestamps
Funnel-related events (page views, actions, conversions)
Control and test groups for A/A/B experimentation

# Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib
SciPy (statistical hypothesis testing)
Jupyter Notebook

# Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory analysis of user behavior
Funnel analysis and conversion rate calculation
A/A testing to validate experiment design and data reliability
A/B testing to evaluate the effect of design changes
Interpretation of statistical results

# Key Insights
User behavior differs across funnel stages
A/A testing confirmed no significant differences between control groups
Design changes tested in the A/B experiment showed measurable effects on user behavior
Results provide actionable insights for UX and product optimization

# Results & Impact
This project demonstrates practical skills in user behavior analysis, experimentation, and statistical validation, relevant to roles in data analysis, product analytics.
